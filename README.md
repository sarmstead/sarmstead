# Well, howdy!👋🏽
My name is Sunjay Armstead. I'm a cross-functional software engineer proficient in JavaScript, HTML, and CSS, specializing in Ruby on Rails and React-based frameworks like Next.js.

## Some of my favorite projects
### sunjayarmstead.com
My portfolio site was built on WordPress for a long time, but the switch to Next.js has been so much fun! Plus I'm saving $180 / year on hosting. Who doesn't like free cash?

### Abate
Imagine an undistracted news experience. No ads, no photos, no videos—just text. Now picture multiple text-only sources in one place. This is Abate.

### Webflow GPT
Webflow is incredibly flexible; a user can shape their database in almost any fashion imaginable. Unfortunately, as the team at ZEAL was making changes to its Webflow site, all of its blog meta descriptions disappeared! ChatGPT, meet Webflow.
